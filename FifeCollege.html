<h2>Fife College</h2>
    
<p>This assignment was handed out by the Fife College during a HND Digital Design and Development course as an exercise to help students improve their skills in website design. Fife College campuses can be found all across Fife from Dunfermline to Glenrothes with multiple other facilities inbetween. These facilities are fantastic areas to get an education/qualification to help students get a start in life.</p>
