 <p class = "btsp">This page is made for the purpose of showing off the process of this game being out together, including some of the early sketches of the avatars and backgrounds. Having an insight into the process is interesting as it displays how everything goes from their own separate sections to becoming a complete product that is on your phone screen. Feel free to enjoy witnessing the game come together piece by piece.</p>
